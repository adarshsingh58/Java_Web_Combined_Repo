* before jdk 7, to concat string we used stringbuilder or stringbuffer as using string directly with
* "+" concat operator was inefficient because multiple intermediate objects were formed.
* On Jdk 7, "+" concat operator by default internally used stringbuilder so that was a great change.
*
* On Jdk8,things are even easier as there is a new API StringJoiner which takes in the seperator/delimiter
* of choice and joins string.
